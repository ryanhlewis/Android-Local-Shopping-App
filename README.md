# Texas Bay

A prototype shopping app built for CS329E: Elements of Mobile Development, T-Bay is a Local Shopping App,
which in this hypothetical world, has cut deals to get a "commission" from each local business, and handles
deliveries for them and provides a large customer boost and support through their massive and centralized
catelog of every local business.

This shopping app includes a few sample products, product pages, a functional Cart and Add to Cart buttons, as well
as a Filter to search through all the products available in your area. These are all hard-coded in for the prototype,
but are written in such a way it would be just as easy to fetch the information from a cloud server by replacing a 
singular line of code.
